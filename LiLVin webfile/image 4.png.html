    The Origin of Lil Vin & Lex Qauv – From Primary School Bars to Drill Brotherhood

Before the beats, before the studio dreams, before the track “Principal” shook the streets — it all started in a primary school classroom, a moment so small yet powerful enough to change lives.

That’s when I met Lex Qauv.

I still remember that day clear as daylight. We were just kids back then — no fame, no gear, just raw energy and too many thoughts in our heads. I dropped a freestyle for the first time in front of him. The moment the words left my mouth, I saw it in his eyes — that spark. Like he already knew I wasn’t just playing around. From that day on, he didn’t let me miss a single debating day at school. Whether it was a mic or a stage or just speaking our truth, he pushed me to show up, to speak up, to shine.

That was the first time I saw what real support looked like — not from the crowd, not from fans, but from someone standing beside you when no one’s even watching yet.

Then came the grind — the long days, the study pressure, and the weight of preparing for our Primary Leaving Examinations. But even in that chaos, we stuck close. We shared the same bed, late nights talking about dreams way bigger than our little room, laughing at nonsense, zoning out into our own universe. It was funny, crazy, and beautiful all at once.

We didn’t have it all figured out. But what we had? Brotherhood. Belief. Vision.

That bond we built back then is the same energy we bring into every track now. The streets might know us as Lil Vin and Lex Qauv, but the roots run deeper than music. This is family. This is fate.

From primary school bars to real-life stars.
From debates to drill.
From a shared bed to a shared dream.

And we’re just getting started.
    Lil Vin & Lex Qauv – From Kikoni to Kings of the Drill Scene

It all started in Uganda, righ in the heart of Kikoni, near the vibrant streets of Makerere. That’s where Lil Vin and Lex Qauv first caught the spark — two young dreamers with nothing but ambition, pain in their verses, and fire in their hearts. Before the beats hit speakers, before anyone knew the names, it was just us, freestyling in corners, letting the hunger speak.

We had a third brother back then — David — a real one from day one. He started this journey with us, shared the dreams, shared the moments. He had to step away, but we never stopped. We respected his decision, and we carried the torch forward for all of us.

Even when the odds were heavy, we stayed grinding, writing, building something from the ground up. We made our breakthrough with the track “Principal.” That wasn’t just a song — it was a statement. It hit hard. It shook the local scene. Everyone in Kikoni knew: Lil Vin and Lex Qauv were coming up different.

Lil Vin brought bars that cut through silence, lyrical truth with every line. Lex Qauv came with that cold, unfiltered drill energy — voice like war, heart like art. Together, we weren’t just making tracks — we were making legacy.

From chilling in small rooms with nothing but borrowed speakers, to banging our sound through every block, we stayed on it. Days with no power, nights with no sleep — still we created, still we believed. We lived the struggle, but we never let the struggle define us. We defined it.

We’re not just rappers.
We’re not just a drill act.
We’re the voice of a generation that refuses to be silenced.

Lil Vin and Lex Qauv — the rawest, realest, and most fearless voices from Kikoni. For every dreamer still hustling, every kid with a pen and a vision, we’re proof that from nothing, something powerful can rise.
