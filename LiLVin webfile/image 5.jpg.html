        Lil Vin’s Journey to Paris – Leaving, But Never Forgetting

Time moved, as it always does. From the dusty corners of Kikoni and the shared dreams in primary school, life started to open new doors. The hustle got louder, and so did the ambition. It wasn’t just about the music anymore — it was about the future.

That’s when the moment came.
Lil Vin was heading to France — to Paris. A whole different world. A new chapter. New energy. A place full of opportunity, where the dream could stretch further than ever before.

But with every step forward, something stayed heavy in the heart — because he wasn’t going with his brother Lex Qauv.

That goodbye? It wasn’t easy. This wasn’t just leaving home. This was leaving behind memories, cyphers, laughs, late-night ideas, and the person who believed in the vision from day one. While one was taking flight, the other was still grinding on the ground. But that bond? Unbreakable.

Even in Paris, where the lights shine brighter, and the beats hit different — Lil Vin never forgot where it all started. He remembered every debating day Lex Qauv hyped him for, every verse they built side by side, every joke on the shared bed, and every dream they shaped in whispers before sleep.

Because real ones don’t fade with distance.
Real ones live in every lyric.
In every move made.
In every goal reached.

Lil Vin left to chase something bigger — not just for himself, but for both of them. For the team. For the legacy.

And no matter how far he goes, Kikoni is still home.
Lex Qauv is still family.
And the good times? They’re the fuel that keeps him going.
